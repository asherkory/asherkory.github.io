I am a multipassionate learner, and I like to keep busy. In addition to programming, I am a sci-fi and fantasy bibliophile, muay thai practitioner, creator of replica costumes, burner, homebrewer, and cat lover. I'm a member of the [501st Legion](http://www.501st.com/) and the [Rebel Legion](http://www.rebellegion.com/), the "bad guys" and "good guys" Star Wars costuming + charity organizations. I also play roller derby with the [Long Island Roller Rebels](http://www.longislandrollerrebels.org/).
