Moving from the familiar framework of Rails to something completely new -- AngularJS -- has been an interesting journey. Here are a handful of my favorite resources on learning Angular. 

First of all, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the actual official AngularJS developer guide. While typically more brief and less in-depth than some of the blog posts I link below, sometimes its conciseness is exactly why it's useful:
[AngularJS.org Developer Guide](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide)

Dan Wahlin has a fantastic series on writing custom directives. This was perhaps the most challenging part of learning Angular for me, so I appreciated his detailed ground-up approach:
[Creating Custom AngularJS Directives](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/creating-custom-angularjs-directives-part-i-the-fundamentals)

Does transclusion seem like confusing "magic"? Tero Parviainen's explanation breaks down transclusion into its very basic concepts, and then explains how the magic happens: [A Guide To Transclusion in AngularJS](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/06/09/transclusion.html)

This article at ThinkingMedia.ca talks about best practices for using scopes. Less of a "how to", more of a "why":
[Learn How to Use $scopes Properly in AngularJS](https://www.thinkingmedia.ca/2015/01/learn-how-to-use-scopes-properly-in-angularjs/)

If you're shaky on the "publish/subscribe" design pattern, Todd Motto breaks down the Angular event system with clear examples:
[Understanding Angularâ€™s $scope and $rootScope event system $emit, $broadcast and $on](https://toddmotto.com/all-about-angulars-emit-broadcast-on-publish-subscribing/)

A deeper dive into using ngMessages with forms, including reusing and overriding error messages, at Yearofmoo.com:
[How to Use ngMessages in AngularJS](http://www.yearofmoo.com/2014/05/how-to-use-ngmessages-in-angularjs.html)

Here's a short and sweet guide to using filters in controllers (instead of views) for improved performance, by Rabi Kiran:
[Invoking AngularJS Filters from Controller](https://dzone.com/articles/invoking-angular-js-filters)

Understanding Angular's digest cycle is incredibly important. Knowing when and how to use $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply is part of that:
[Using $scope.$watch and $scope.$apply](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15112584/using-scope-watch-and-scope-apply-in-angularjs)

In fact, important enough to merit a second article on the subject! Here's another on $scope.$watch et cetera. As a bonus, check out the other Angular articles in the sidebar by Jakob Jenkov:
[AngularJS $watch(), $digest() and $apply()](http://tutorials.jenkov.com/angularjs/watch-digest-apply.html)


These are just a selection of the many, many helpful articles and blog posts on AngularJS out there. Got a favorite I didn't list? Let me know!
