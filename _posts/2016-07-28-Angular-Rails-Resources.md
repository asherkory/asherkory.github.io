Looking to combine an AngularJS frontend framework with a Ruby on Rails backend? Here are a handful of helpful articles and tutorials I've used. Many of these guides accomplish similar goals in slightly different ways, and so illustrate a variety of approaches you can use for setting up your app.

First up is Luke Ghenco's step-by-step guide. He creates a simple CRUD app using $resource to demonstrate how to link Angular and Rails. Luke is a fellow Flatiron School Learn Verified graduate.
[Create an AngularJS App with a RESTful Rails API](https://medium.com/@lukeghenco/create-an-angular-js-app-with-a-restful-rails-api-pt-1-58121eb6e4f9#.xx9ihph92)

Here's a great tutorial from Sitepoint with more detail on using $resource for RESTful APIs.
[Creating a CRUD App in Minutes with Angular's $resource](https://www.sitepoint.com/creating-crud-app-minutes-angulars-resource/)

This beginner's guide from Honeybadger walks through the process of getting your app up and running, and includes some test-writing.

Another step-by-step walkthrough from Bendyworks, this time of a Donuts-themed app. This guide uses the Restangular JS library to assist in consuming RESTful APIs, and the Rails Assets gem to manage the front-end libraries.

This tutorial on Angular-rails.com demonstrates how to install Bootstrap for styling, explains how to use Bower and the bower-rails gem for front-end dependency management, and deploys to Heroku.
