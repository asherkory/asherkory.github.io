title: Lessons from Learning and Working Remotely
tags: career, learn-co

The coding bootcamp I attended, the Flatiron School's Learn Verified, was a remote online-based version of their immersive in-person program. All the resources of (and actually more curriculum materials than) the in-person program, but without the daily commute. I found it immensely valuable, and fit seamlessly with my learning style. But there are a few unique challenges to learning and working remotely: how do you stay focused? How do you keep on track without an instructor leaning over your shoulder? And how do you untangle yourself when you're stuck on a tough problem?

challenge 1: staying focused.
keep to a schedule
sure, you have the freedom to sleep in if you pulled a late night, but try to get up and moving at the same time each weekday
maintain routine - establishing a habit makes it a billion times easier to keep doing a thing when it's hard
discipline

challenge 2: momentum and progress
keep track of progress
acknowledge progress via small steps: e.g. completing Learn's lessons/labs, note bite-size chunks of forward momentum
for a longer project, maybe keep track of each feature written or bug stamped out or github commit
goal is to keep moving forward a bit at a time -- don't get bogged down on one problem or spend hours reading only-slightly-related docs or get distracted by an unnecessary feature
have a clear roadmap of where you're going

challenge 3: getting unstuck, getting help
what happens when you're stuck?
google, stack overflow, blog posts, reading what other people have done -- refining search terms to get answers is an art
reading official documentation
reviewing previous code I've written, old concepts
talking to other students
"rubber duck" debugging -- talk to my cat, talk the problem out loud often helps find the solution
asking instructors (who don't just provide answers but walk you through a problem)
